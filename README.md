#Rotate13
========

This simple project uses Python to create a rotate 13 cipher, or  
known as a Caesar Cipher. This cipher takes in a line of text and  
encrypts it by replacing it with the 13th letter down. 


###Requirements
------------
This program requires [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to run. This program
was build using Python 2.7.


###Features
========
1.  This program offers fast, but unsophisticated, text encryption. 

2.  The encrypted text can be entered back into the program to be deciphered


###Installation
============

Once Python is installed on the machine, simply run the program and enter
the desired text in the prompt.
